## Overview

**There are 8 sections in this workbook.** This workbook begins by discussing the idea of time and the units we use to group moments in time.

After we review first principles and vocabulary and related to time, we introduce the concept of timekeeping using clocks or chronometers.

Next, we use symbols, scalars. and units to describe and predict various day events. Clock times are the symbols that are converted to scalars on number lines, which are characterized by units. These number lines implement geometric concepts that we can use to predict the position of the sun throughout the day.

Additionally, students practice converting clock times into the corresponding clock hands angles that are displayed on analog clock faces to represent time.

The workbook concludes with a review of all the key concepts and some open-ended design problems.

This OER includes media (e.g., YouTube videos) and technical computing demonstrations (e.g., Wolfram Alpha).

Also, unlike many workbooks or textbooks that try to cover many topics, this OER is specifically designed to focus on the math skills required to solve clock math problems. The process of reaching any learning goal in math requires a balance of practice (recognition and repitition), higher order thinking skills, and relevance to real-world applications.

> **NOTE:** We recommend that you do not cram or rush to finish all the chapters and exercises. Instead, you should take your time.

Good luck and have fun!

## 35.1 Time Basics

Time is simply a tool. No, no, no: not a manual or power tool, like ones at Home Depot.

Time is an abstract tool. Because it is an abstract tool, time is an interesting idea that can be applied to building or understanding other things.

Again, time is simply a tool.

When we think about tools, we often think about hammers, screwdrivers, and wrenches. Measuring tapes are also very useful tools. They help us measure distances between two points in space.

Time is a valuable tool in a similar way. It was invented to help us measure the distance between moments. In order to conduct that measurement between moments, time requires a fixed point of reference, which is usually an event.

In this workbook, we focus on solar events because they are reliable, recurring events.

Here are some examples of time words that use a point of reference: yesterday, today, tomorrow, before, now, after, long ago, soon, and forever.

Each of these words implicitly refer to some positive or negative distance from a **fixed point of reference** in time.

Time on Earth is based on events related to the motion of Earth within our Solar system. From scientific evidence, we can use the following facts as first principles:

  + **There are 365 days in a year.** Earth revolves around the Sun, once per year. This reliable, recurring event helps us track months and years on Earth.
  + **There are 24 hours in a day.** Earth rotates about its axis, once per day. This recurring event allows us to track sunrise and sunset times, which are partly based on geolocation, as well as Earth's orbit around the Sun.

These facts are integrated into human language. When clock time is mentioned, we implicitly use these first principles to describe the amount of time that has elapsed since a new day (midnight), a new month, or a new year.

For example, colloquially, we say "7:30 AM" instead of saying "it has been 7 hours and 30 minutes since midnight" because it is more convenient and easier to comprehend.

However, in our math calculations, it is very important for us to include explanatory units, such as "since midnight" for clarity (following MUCOW standards).

After midnight, another day begins.

[![After Midnight](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkWccgl-9vs/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkWccgl-9vs "After Midnight")

For intraday clock math problems, we will usually have between 0 and 24 hours (or 1440 minutes) since midnight.

Midnight and other boundary condition are a very important details that we must consider when solving elapsed time word problems. Time problems tend to be design problems due to the continuous nature of time.

Each day can be viewed as a slice of time (discussed further in [35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices).

An abstraction of these events (e.g., since midnight, since the new year, etc.) can be placed on a number line.

Thus, time can represented by a number line, too. This special type of number line is often called a timeline.

Timelines can be labeled with either symbols or scalars to represent points in time.

> **NOTE:** Scalars are often mentioned in the context of vector mathematics. In this workbook, we will discuss scalars as real numbers that may be optionally accompanied by units.

Timelines can be used to represent sequential or simultaneous events. There are many examples of timelines, including historical timelines (in years) or podcast playlist (in minutes).

**Calendars** are timelines, too.

You can view calendar timelines using a big picture view, such as months or years (e.g., financial or marketing schedules). You can also use a detailed view, such as hours or minutes (e.g., radio stations schedules).

We have introduced the basics of time that will be used throughout this workbook.

In the next section ([35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices)), we will explore how slicing and bundling time into groupings can be very useful.

Until then, take a few moments to review what we have discussed in this chapter.

When it comes to mastering time basics, the time is now.

[![John Cena - My Time Is Now](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_JAa3NvP6f4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JAa3NvP6f4 "John Cena - My Time Is Now")

## 35.2 Time Slices

[![Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time (Audio)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F1mqrCTFoz4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1mqrCTFoz4&feature=emb_title "Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time (Audio)")

In the previous section, we discussed the utility and basics of a useful tool called time.

Time is used to measure the distance between moments. We use Earth's movements in our solar system to determine how to add numerical values that describe the "distances" between those moments.

Moments come and go, based on our frame of reference. Our memories are recollections of those past moments. These memories feel like they take us back in time.

Time is a tool that helps us understand past moments while allowing us to make reasonable predictions for future moments.

It is true that we can reminisce about past moments. We can also celebrate the arrival of a current moment. We have anticipated a specific moment for a certain amount of time (a time slice). We experience this anticipation every New Year's Eve, as we countdown the moments until New Year's Day.


In this section, we will discuss how time slices (groups of time) can be even more useful when measured and compared.

Let us practice identifying and describing time slices. Time slices in nature can be based on seasonal events (e.g., Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter).

[![Four Seasons ~ Vivaldi](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GRxofEmo3HA/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA&feature=emb_title "Four Seasons ~ Vivaldi")

In other cases, time slices can be used to denote an era or special time period (e.g., the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, the Victorian era, ante meridiem, post meridiem, etc).

Time slices can also be described as "bundles" of time. For example, wall calendars help us comprehend the passage of time in years, months, weeks, and days.

To help us manage modern time, we have grouped 7 days into a week and at least 28 days into every month. No matter how many days in each month, there are exactly 12 months in a year.

We use this understanding to plan for the future. For example, if something is scheduled to happen in 15 months, we automatically understand that the event will happen in the following year.

Using another example, in the tech industry, the second Tuesday of every month is called Patch Tuesday. The predictability of this day allows companies to plan for computer hardware and software maintenance.

> **NOTE:** The SI units for time are seconds. [Learn more](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fphysics.nist.gov%2Fcuu%2FUnits%2Fcurrent.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw22r4DLDWXVelEe3Dh2vd6n)

The numerical measurement of time between two moments can be called duration. **Duration** is a length of time. In other words, duration is a slice of time that describes the distance between two moments.

In this workbook, slices describe the parts of a whole, like the slices from a pie (or pizza). Sometimes these fractions are combined with other whole pies.

Think about leftover pizza from a birthday party and how you combine the slices for storage in the freezer or donation to charities that fight hunger. As you collect mutliple leftovers from multiple boxes, you will accumulate bundles of pizza (whole pizzas) that can be eaten later.

It is also important to note that even though these pizza slices are bundled, you still know how many total slices that are available.

> **NOTE:** Some baking recipes call for heating food in an oven for durations between 75 and 85 minutes. In this case, the recipes are specifically using minutes to bundle the number of seconds needed for baking, while allowing easy comparisons between other baking times.

Music albums are comprised of individual audio tracks. Each of those tracks can be described with a duration as a clock time (35.3 Clock Basics) in minutes and seconds.

Instead of using seconds, we use bundles of seconds to describe the various track times.

### Time Zones

Let us now reflect on the pizza slice analogy for a moment. The pizza is a flat object, so we generally think about the slices as sections of a circle.

As the Earth rotates about its axis, the Sun shines on certain regions. That rotation is constant, so technically there can be over 86,400 different time slices on a spherical Earth.

To simplify timekeeping, we have created at least 24 time zones to help us group these moments into fewer time slices. With time zones, time management is less stressful and more cost-effective.

Now, let us talk about another kind of timekeeping, which is defined by time signatures in music,

### Time Signatures

Composers share musical with performers with a time tool called sheet music. The musical notes in sheet music are divided into time slices called measures. Measures provide a bookmark for quick reference, and help organize the amount of sound (or silence) within a composition.

The tempo and structure of the musical composition is mainly determined by time signature. Time signatures indicate the number of beats per measure, as well as the notation basis for each beat. For example, a 2/4 time signature indicates that there two beats measure and the quarter note is the basis for each beat.

Singers and instrumentalists look at the time signature of the music composition to better understand the pace or style of the musical work.

Some musical genres use certain time signatures to organize musical ideas.

Marches are usually in 2/4 time. This helps participants in a parade march to the beat with precision. Each measure is typically marked by the loud "boom" of a bass drum. Every Fourth of July, John Philip Sousa's "Washington Post March" can be heard being played from coast to coast.

[![Sousa - The Washington Post March](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOCxegQupMU/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOCxegQupMU&feature=emb_title "Sousa - The Washington Post March")

Waltzes are generally in 3/4 time. The beginning of each ("boom-chuck-chuck") measure helps ballroom dancers keep pace with the music. One of the most famous waltzes in the world is the "The Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss (junior).

Many musical compositions are written in 4/4 time (also known as common time), which makes it a versatile time tool for orchestral composers. For example, Franz Joseph Haydn uses common time in the "Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major", a classical music piece that was used as a way to demonstrated the features of a new Anton Weidinger invention called the keyed trumpet.

[![Alison Balsom, 'Haydn Trumpet Concerto in Eb, 1st mov.' (Allegro)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUZYoVw7moc/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUZYoVw7moc "Alison Balsom, 'Haydn Trumpet Concerto in Eb, 1st mov.' (Allegro)")

Some songs have more than 4 beats per measure, such as Dave Brubeck's jazz standard called "Take Five", written in 5/4 time. There are 5 beats in each measure.

[![Dave Brubeck - Take Five](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vmDDOFXSgAs/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs&feature=emb_title "Dave Brubeck - Take Five")

Dave Brubeck also wrote "Unsquare Dance", which has a time signature of 7/4 time. The tempo increases gradually throughout the song, but we still always have 7 beats per measure.

[![Unsquare Dance](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lbdEzRfbeH4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbdEzRfbeH4&feature=emb_title "Unsquare Dance")

Additionally, songs can alternate between two or more time signatures, such as "Turn It On Again" by Genesis.

[![Genesis - Turn It on Again](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/StfLy3pzno0/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StfLy3pzno0 "Genesis - Turn It on Again")

Time signatures also serve as a useful tool to ensure all the sounds (or silence) of each measure adds up. For example, in 4/4 time (also known as common time), we have 4 beats per measure, with the quarter note as the basis. If there is a whole note (which is equal to 4 quarter notes) in the measure, no other notes can be added in that measure. On the other hand, if there are two quarter notes in the measure, the remaining notes may include a half note (which is equal to 2 quarter notes).

The main idea here is that time signatures provide a mathematical structure for musical composition and performance. The notation helps the composer organize the notes (and multiple instruments) into manageable time slices, while providing more comprehensible information for performers.

Here is an example from the film Amadeus (1984), where two composers are using time signatures and measures to organize various vocalists and instrumentalists on a score.

[![Mozart and Salieri write 'Requiem in D Minor' (Full HD) - Amadeus (1984)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USe-wZ0AOQQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USe-wZ0AOQQ&feature=emb_title "Mozart and Salieri write 'Requiem in D Minor' (Full HD) - Amadeus (1984)")

As we have discussed, time signatures help us organize musical ideas. We will now explore how tempo is used to control the rate at which these ideas are played.

### Tempo

While the time signature in music defines the beats per measure, the tempo determines the beats per minute. In other words, the tempo indicates how much music will be played (or not played) within moments in time.

Cardio workout music tends have a fast tempo, with frequent strong, loud bass beats marking the time. On the other hand, music for relaxation tends to have a slow tempo, with quiet and gentle notes heard for extended periods of time.

Inspirational music may have have a fast tempo with elements found in relaxing music.

[![Alliance - Pillars of Creation [Epic Inspirational Orchestral]](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzS2ju1wh3I/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzS2ju1wh3I&feature=emb_title "Alliance - Pillars of Creation [Epic Inspirational Orchestral]")

Real-time events have a constant tempo. In order to gain a different perspective, we need to capture real-time events at different speeds. We will now talk about slow-motion and time-lapse video recording.

Slow-motion video

Slow motion ("slo-mo") video allows us to review certain events from a different time perspective. We can capture more still picture frames per second in order to observe more details about moments in time.

FOr example, if you spend time in the "film room" studying replays of sporting events, you are often using slow motion to review the progression of events within specific time slices. This is a wonderful use of time as a tool.

Professional athletes who spend time in the film room are better able to prepare for upcoming opponents while correcting mistakes from previous games. The film room is one of many important uses of time for improving both individual and team peformance.

Slow motion is also very useful in other activities, such as crash testing automobiles.

[![Red-light-running crash test demonstration](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S3-esjKXh5g/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3-esjKXh5g&feature=emb_title "Red-light-running crash test demonstration")

When we view slow-motion video from multiple angles simultaenously, we have bullet time.

[![Neo Dodging Bullets | The Matrix](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODmhPsgqGgQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODmhPsgqGgQ&feature=emb_title "Neo Dodging Bullets | The Matrix")

When we mix bullet time with computational photography, you can generate photogrammetry and other 3D informatics.

We can view slow-motion as a high-resolution time inspection tool. Let us now look at a low-resolution time tool called time lapse.

### Time-lapse video

The time-lapse photography technique allows us to capture fewer details about smaller moment, while providing a better time perspective of much larger moments.

We can see a valuable application of this principle in time-lapse video (or film).

While slow-motion video adds more picture frames per socond, time-lapse video may only record new picture frames every minute or every hour. This is a popular film technique on construction sites over several months.

[![Home Build Time-Lapse](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fb531GJrCQY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb531GJrCQY&feature=emb_title "Home Build Time-Lapse")

Also, we can watch plants grow over several days.

In the next chapter (35.3 Clock Basics), we are going to talk about how innovation in timekeeping gives us more time to focus on other things.
