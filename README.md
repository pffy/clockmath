## Overview

**There are 8 sections in this workbook.** This workbook begins by discussing the idea of time and the units we use to group moments in time.

After we review first principles and vocabulary and related to time, we introduce the concept of timekeeping using clocks or chronometers.

Next, we use symbols, scalars. and units to describe and predict various day events. Clock times are the symbols that are converted to scalars on number lines, which are characterized by units. These number lines implement geometric concepts that we can use to predict the position of the sun throughout the day.

Additionally, students practice converting clock times into the corresponding clock hands angles that are displayed on analog clock faces to represent time.

The workbook concludes with a review of all the key concepts and some open-ended design problems.

This OER includes media (e.g., YouTube videos) and technical computing demonstrations (e.g., Wolfram Alpha).

Also, unlike many workbooks or textbooks that try to cover many topics, this OER is specifically designed to focus on the math skills required to solve clock math problems. The process of reaching any learning goal in math requires a balance of practice (recognition and repitition), higher order thinking skills, and relevance to real-world applications.

> **NOTE:** We recommend that you do not cram or rush to finish all the chapters and exercises. Instead, you should take your time.

Good luck and have fun!

# 35.1 Time Basics

Time is simply a tool. No, no, no: not a manual or power tool, like ones at Home Depot.

Time is an abstract tool. Because it is an abstract tool, time is an interesting idea that can be applied to building or understanding other things.

Again, time is simply a tool.

When we think about tools, we often think about hammers, screwdrivers, and wrenches. Measuring tapes are also very useful tools. They help us measure distances between two points in space.

Time is a valuable tool in a similar way. It was invented to help us measure the distance between moments. In order to conduct that measurement between moments, time requires a fixed point of reference, which is usually an event.

In this workbook, we focus on solar events because they are reliable, recurring events.

Here are some examples of time words that use a point of reference: yesterday, today, tomorrow, before, now, after, long ago, soon, and forever.

Each of these words implicitly refer to some positive or negative distance from a **fixed point of reference** in time.

Time on Earth is based on events related to the motion of Earth within our Solar system. From scientific evidence, we can use the following facts as first principles:

  + **There are 365 days in a year.** Earth revolves around the Sun, once per year. This reliable, recurring event helps us track months and years on Earth.
  + **There are 24 hours in a day.** Earth rotates about its axis, once per day. This recurring event allows us to track sunrise and sunset times, which are partly based on geolocation, as well as Earth's orbit around the Sun.

These facts are integrated into human language. When clock time is mentioned, we implicitly use these first principles to describe the amount of time that has elapsed since a new day (midnight), a new month, or a new year.

For example, colloquially, we say "7:30 AM" instead of saying "it has been 7 hours and 30 minutes since midnight" because it is more convenient and easier to comprehend.

However, in our math calculations, it is very important for us to include explanatory units, such as "since midnight" for clarity (following MUCOW standards).

After midnight, another day begins.

[![After Midnight](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkWccgl-9vs/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkWccgl-9vs "After Midnight")

For intraday clock math problems, we will usually have between 0 and 24 hours (or 1440 minutes) since midnight.

Midnight and other boundary condition are a very important details that we must consider when solving elapsed time word problems. Time problems tend to be design problems due to the continuous nature of time.

Each day can be viewed as a slice of time (discussed further in [35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices).

An abstraction of these events (e.g., since midnight, since the new year, etc.) can be placed on a number line.

Thus, time can represented by a number line, too. This special type of number line is often called a timeline.

Timelines can be labeled with either symbols or scalars to represent points in time.

> **NOTE:** Scalars are often mentioned in the context of vector mathematics. In this workbook, we will discuss scalars as real numbers that may be optionally accompanied by units.

Timelines can be used to represent sequential or simultaneous events. There are many examples of timelines, including historical timelines (in years) or podcast playlist (in minutes).

**Calendars** are timelines, too.

You can view calendar timelines using a big picture view, such as months or years (e.g., financial or marketing schedules). You can also use a detailed view, such as hours or minutes (e.g., radio stations schedules).

We have introduced the basics of time that will be used throughout this workbook.

In the next section ([35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices)), we will explore how slicing and bundling time into groupings can be very useful.

Until then, take a few moments to review what we have discussed in this chapter.

When it comes to mastering time basics, the time is now.

# 35.2 Time Slices

[![Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time (Audio)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F1mqrCTFoz4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1mqrCTFoz4&feature=emb_title "Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time (Audio)")

In the previous section, we discussed the utility and basics of a useful tool called time.

Time is used to measure the distance between moments. We use Earth's movements in our solar system to determine how to add numerical values that describe the "distances" between those moments.

Moments come and go, based on our frame of reference. Our memories are recollections of those past moments. These memories feel like they take us back in time.

Time is a tool that helps us understand past moments while allowing us to make reasonable predictions for future moments.

It is true that we can reminisce about past moments. We can also celebrate the arrival of a current moment. We have anticipated a specific moment for a certain amount of time (a time slice). We experience this anticipation every New Year's Eve, as we countdown the moments until New Year's Day.

In this section, we will discuss how time slices (groups of time) can be even more useful when measured and compared.

Let us practice identifying and describing time slices. Time slices in nature can be based on seasonal events (e.g., Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter).

[![Four Seasons ~ Vivaldi](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GRxofEmo3HA/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA&feature=emb_title "Four Seasons ~ Vivaldi")

In other cases, time slices can be used to denote an era or special time period (e.g., the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, the Victorian era, ante meridiem, post meridiem, etc).

Time slices can also be described as "bundles" of time. For example, wall calendars help us comprehend the passage of time in years, months, weeks, and days.

To help us manage modern time, we have grouped 7 days into a week and at least 28 days into every month. No matter how many days in each month, there are exactly 12 months in a year.

We use this understanding to plan for the future. For example, if something is scheduled to happen in 15 months, we automatically understand that the event will happen in the following year.

Using another example, in the tech industry, the second Tuesday of every month is called Patch Tuesday. The predictability of this day allows companies to plan for computer hardware and software maintenance.

> **NOTE:** The SI units for time are seconds. [Learn more](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fphysics.nist.gov%2Fcuu%2FUnits%2Fcurrent.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw22r4DLDWXVelEe3Dh2vd6n)

The numerical measurement of time between two moments can be called duration. **Duration** is a length of time. In other words, duration is a slice of time that describes the distance between two moments.

In this workbook, slices describe the parts of a whole, like the slices from a pie (or pizza). Sometimes these fractions are combined with other whole pies.

Think about leftover pizza from a birthday party and how you combine the slices for storage in the freezer or donation to charities that fight hunger. As you collect mutliple leftovers from multiple boxes, you will accumulate bundles of pizza (whole pizzas) that can be eaten later.

It is also important to note that even though these pizza slices are bundled, you still know how many total slices that are available.

> **NOTE:** Some baking recipes call for heating food in an oven for durations between 75 and 85 minutes. In this case, the recipes are specifically using minutes to bundle the number of seconds needed for baking, while allowing easy comparisons between other baking times.

Music albums are comprised of individual audio tracks. Each of those tracks can be described with a duration as a clock time (discussed later in [35.3 Clock Basics](#353-clock-basics)) in minutes and seconds.

Instead of using seconds, we use bundles of seconds to describe the various track times.

```
Time bundles table goes here.
```

## Time Zones

Let us now reflect on the pizza slice analogy for a moment. The pizza is a flat object, so we generally think about the slices as sections of a circle.

As the Earth rotates about its axis, the Sun shines on certain regions. That rotation is constant, so technically there can be over 86,400 different time slices on a spherical Earth.

To simplify timekeeping, we have created at least 24 time zones to help us group these moments into fewer time slices. With time zones, time management is less stressful and more cost-effective.

Now, let us talk about another kind of timekeeping, which is defined by time signatures in music,

## Time Signatures

Composers share musical with performers with a time tool called sheet music. The musical notes in sheet music are divided into time slices called measures. Measures provide a bookmark for quick reference, and help organize the amount of sound (or silence) within a composition.

The tempo and structure of the musical composition is mainly determined by time signature. Time signatures indicate the number of beats per measure, as well as the notation basis for each beat. For example, a 2/4 time signature indicates that there two beats measure and the quarter note is the basis for each beat.

Singers and instrumentalists look at the time signature of the music composition to better understand the pace or style of the musical work.

Some musical genres use certain time signatures to organize musical ideas.

Marches are usually in 2/4 time. This helps participants in a parade march to the beat with precision. Each measure is typically marked by the loud "boom" of a bass drum. Every Fourth of July, John Philip Sousa's "Washington Post March" can be heard being played from coast to coast.

[![Sousa - The Washington Post March](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOCxegQupMU/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOCxegQupMU&feature=emb_title "Sousa - The Washington Post March")

Waltzes are generally in 3/4 time. The beginning of each ("boom-chuck-chuck") measure helps ballroom dancers keep pace with the music. One of the most famous waltzes in the world is the "The Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss (junior).

[![Johann Strauss II - The Blue Danube Waltz](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CTYymbbEL4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTYymbbEL4 "Johann Strauss II - The Blue Danube Waltz")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: The Blue Danube Waltz - Johann Strauss II**

Many musical compositions are written in 4/4 time (also known as common time), which makes it a versatile time tool for orchestral composers. For example, Franz Joseph Haydn uses common time in the "Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major", a classical music piece that was used as a way to demonstrated the features of a new Anton Weidinger invention called the keyed trumpet.

[![Alison Balsom, 'Haydn Trumpet Concerto in Eb, 1st mov.' (Allegro)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUZYoVw7moc/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUZYoVw7moc "Alison Balsom, 'Haydn Trumpet Concerto in Eb, 1st mov.' (Allegro)")

Some songs have more than 4 beats per measure, such as Dave Brubeck's jazz standard called "Take Five", written in 5/4 time. There are 5 beats in each measure.

[![Dave Brubeck - Take Five](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vmDDOFXSgAs/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs&feature=emb_title "Dave Brubeck - Take Five")

Dave Brubeck also wrote "Unsquare Dance", which has a time signature of 7/4 time. The tempo increases gradually throughout the song, but we still always have 7 beats per measure.

[![Unsquare Dance](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lbdEzRfbeH4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbdEzRfbeH4&feature=emb_title "Unsquare Dance")

Additionally, songs can alternate between two or more time signatures, such as "Turn It On Again" by Genesis.

[![Genesis - Turn It on Again](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/StfLy3pzno0/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StfLy3pzno0 "Genesis - Turn It on Again")

Time signatures also serve as a useful tool to ensure all the sounds (or silence) of each measure adds up. For example, in 4/4 time (also known as common time), we have 4 beats per measure, with the quarter note as the basis. If there is a whole note (which is equal to 4 quarter notes) in the measure, no other notes can be added in that measure. On the other hand, if there are two quarter notes in the measure, the remaining notes may include a half note (which is equal to 2 quarter notes).

The main idea here is that time signatures provide a mathematical structure for musical composition and performance. The notation helps the composer organize the notes (and multiple instruments) into manageable time slices, while providing more comprehensible information for performers.

Here is an example from the film Amadeus (1984), where two composers are using time signatures and measures to organize various vocalists and instrumentalists on a score.

[![Mozart and Salieri write 'Requiem in D Minor' (Full HD) - Amadeus (1984)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USe-wZ0AOQQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USe-wZ0AOQQ&feature=emb_title "Mozart and Salieri write 'Requiem in D Minor' (Full HD) - Amadeus (1984)")

As we have discussed, time signatures help us organize musical ideas. We will now explore how tempo is used to control the rate at which these ideas are played.

## Tempo

While the time signature in music defines the beats per measure, the tempo determines the beats per minute. In other words, the tempo indicates how much music will be played (or not played) within moments in time.

Cardio workout music tends have a fast tempo, with frequent strong, loud bass beats marking the time. On the other hand, music for relaxation tends to have a slow tempo, with quiet and gentle notes heard for extended periods of time.

Inspirational music may have have a fast tempo with elements found in relaxing music.

[![Alliance - Pillars of Creation [Epic Inspirational Orchestral]](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzS2ju1wh3I/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzS2ju1wh3I&feature=emb_title "Alliance - Pillars of Creation [Epic Inspirational Orchestral]")

Real-time events have a constant tempo. In order to gain a different perspective, we need to capture real-time events at different speeds. We will now talk about slow-motion and time-lapse video recording.

## Slow-motion video

Slow motion ("slo-mo") video allows us to review certain events from a different time perspective. We can capture more still picture frames per second in order to observe more details about moments in time.

FOr example, if you spend time in the "film room" studying replays of sporting events, you are often using slow motion to review the progression of events within specific time slices. This is a wonderful use of time as a tool.

Professional athletes who spend time in the film room are better able to prepare for upcoming opponents while correcting mistakes from previous games. The film room is one of many important uses of time for improving both individual and team peformance.

Slow motion is also very useful in other activities, such as crash testing automobiles.

[![Red-light-running crash test demonstration](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S3-esjKXh5g/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3-esjKXh5g&feature=emb_title "Red-light-running crash test demonstration")

When we view slow-motion video from multiple angles simultaenously, we have bullet time.

[![Neo Dodging Bullets - The Matrix](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODmhPsgqGgQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODmhPsgqGgQ&feature=emb_title "Neo Dodging Bullets - The Matrix")

When we mix bullet time with computational photography, you can generate photogrammetry and other 3D informatics.

We can view slow-motion as a high-resolution time inspection tool. Let us now look at a low-resolution time tool called time lapse.

## Time-lapse video

The time-lapse photography technique allows us to capture fewer details about smaller moment, while providing a better time perspective of much larger moments.

We can see a valuable application of this principle in time-lapse video (or film).

While slow-motion video adds more picture frames per socond, time-lapse video may only record new picture frames every minute or every hour. This is a popular film technique on construction sites over several months.

[![Home Build Time-Lapse](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fb531GJrCQY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb531GJrCQY&feature=emb_title "Home Build Time-Lapse")

Also, we can watch plants grow over several days.

[![Bean Time-Lapse - 25 days - Soil cross section](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w77zPAtVTuI/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77zPAtVTuI "Bean Time-Lapse - 25 days - Soil cross section")

In the next section, we discuss how innovation in timekeeping gives us more time to focus on other things.


# 35.3 Clock Basics

[![Hung Up](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20OGm_-RebE/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20OGm_-RebE "Hung Up")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Hung Up - Madonna**

Clock time is a tool that helps us keep track of another tool called time (as discussed in earlier in [35.1 Time Basics]($351-time-basics)). Clock time is often represented by a symbol (e.g., 6:30 AM, 13:15) that refers to an event-based time.

If we simply look at clock time as "something" we should know, then we may not completely understand what the symbols represent.

Instead, we will look more closely and carefully at clock time as a symbol and reflect on how we interpret that symbol to communicate specific moments in time.

When we learn to count to ten, we are using a base 10 numerals. Larger numbers are grouped in bundles of 10 whenever possible.

Clock time introduces us to base 60 (or [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal)) counting. We bundle 60 seconds in a minute; we also group 60 minutes in an hour.

In other words, we count from 0 to 59 seconds, and add a minute to our overall total. Also, when reach 60 minutes, another hour has elapsed.

With this in mind, let us think about the math we use when we set an analog clock or mechanical watch. We know the current clock time, and we need to set that clock to match that time.

A complete 60-minute trip around the clock face is 360 degrees. That fact helps us determine an approximate angle for the minute hand.

Our minds are set on the percentage of those 60 minutes that have elapsed within the hour, Percentage represent a fraction of 100, but each minute (of the hour) is a fraction of 60.

[![George Harrison - Got My Mind Set On You (Version II)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_71w4UA2Oxo/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_71w4UA2Oxo "George Harrison - Got My Mind Set On You (Version II)")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Got my mind set on you - George Harrison**

If we look at clock time as a symbol that describes two quantities, we can see a mixed number.

For example, let us look at the clock time 6:30 AM.

In this case, the colon separates the mixed number into two parts.

The left side of the clock time is the whole number part that represents the current hour. We are in the six o'clock hour, which is more than 6 hours after midnight.

The right side of the clock time is the fractional part that indicates the number of minutes that have elapsed since the top of the hour. Within the six o'clock hour, 30 minutes have passed and 30 minutes remain.

The fraction of the hour can be written as 30/60 hours (or 0.5 hours).

Mixed numbers are usually written as whole numbers in large text with fractions in smaller text. This is simply notation to help us better understand the quantity. Clock time uses the same concept of mixed numbers, but uses a different notation.

Clock time is a mixed number that contains information about whole hours and fractions of hours.

Because clock time (as a mixed number) is common in clock math, this workbook has a table that helps us make calculations with fractions of 60 ([Table B: Fractions of 60](/TABLE-B.md)).

> **USING ALEXA:** When you use the voice command "time" with the Amazon Alexa voice assistant or smart speaker, the application programming interface (API) assumes you mean "clock time" as input.

The API requires you to ask a specific question related to time. For example, you can ask "how many minutes since midnight?" or "how many seconds since midnight?" for a non-clock answer.

In each case, the previous midnight of the current day is the fixed point of reference used to provide you an answer. You can also ask these questions to Wolfram Alpha:

  + [how many seconds since midnight?](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=how+many+seconds+since+midnight%3F)
  + [how many minutes since midnight?](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=how+many+minutes+since+midnight%3F)

## Clock Talk

Now, let's talk about clocks -- well, clock devices.

Some clocks tick to mark the passing of a second; some do not. For decades, clocks have captured the imagination of artists and musicians.

[![Leroy Anderson - The Syncopated Clock](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CrpdQngwk2g/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrpdQngwk2g "Leroy Anderson - The Syncopated Clock")

[![J. Haydn - Hob I:101 - Symphony No. 101 in D major "The clock" (BrÃ¼ggen)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W9Qtu15FLTM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Qtu15FLTM "J. Haydn - Hob I:101 - Symphony No. 101 in D major "The clock" (BrÃ¼ggen)")

[![Hans Zimmer - Mountains (Interstellar Soundtrack)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o_Ay_iDRAbc/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Ay_iDRAbc "Hans Zimmer - Mountains (Interstellar Soundtrack)")

The local event that is the basis for clock time occurs when the Earth completes a single rotation about its axis and automatically begins another one. Every midnight represents a clock time boundary that separates the previous day from the next day.

As mentioned earlier (35.1 Time Basics), we say "6:30 AM" instead of saying "6 hours and 30 minutes since midnight" because it easier to understand.

The 12-hour clock format requires the use of AM or PM to signify the time of day -- whether the time is before or after noon (12:00 PM).

Another clock format called 24-hour time allows to express the number of hours and minutes since midnight without the AM/PM suffix.

For example, when we say the time is "13:15", we are saying that it is "13 hours and 15 minutes since midnight" which permits us to omit AM/PM from the clock time.

> **NOTE:** Another term for 24-hour time is military time.

Timekeeping and horology have been studied for many centuries. Before clocks, sundials and star charts were used to keep track of time.

The invention of clocks helped keep local time, but not always accurately. For example, clock time could vary between two towns or two houses.

Each analog clock had a different clock time, internal mechanism, and maintenance schedule.

Many towns simply had a single town clock or church bells to help everyone nearby keep time.

[![Inside Bern, Switzerland's Clock Tower](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmX3xE_Pick/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmX3xE_Pick "Inside Bern, Switzerland's Clock Tower")

In order to "perform work" on clock math problems, we must learn how to convert between clock times and the number of hours, minutes, and seconds since midnight.

[![Amilcare Ponchielli - Dance of the Hours](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W3ILbnHhAzk/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3ILbnHhAzk "Amilcare Ponchielli - Dance of the Hours")

The skills related to clock time conversion wil make solving clock math problems more simple and organized.

### Exercise 35.3.1

Convert the following clock time symbols to:
  - number of minutes since midnight,
  - number of seconds since midnight,
  - percent of day elapsed

```
6:30 AM
13:15
9:25 PM
12:00 PM
20:45
9:00 AM
17:00
```

# 35.4 Clock Slices

Clock slices describe sections of clock time (35.3 Clock Basics).

On a circular clock face, clock slices may resemble circular sectors (see Circular Sectors on Wolfram MathWorld).

Sectors are shaped like pie slices. In fact, we can use pie charts to diagram clock slices. The angular position of the hands on a clock also provide pie-like sectors (discussed later in 35.8 Clock Hands Angles).

On a timeline (a special number line that represents time), we can depict clock slices as linear segments.

In our first discussion about time, we noted that a fixed point of reference is required in order to effectively use time as tool. Using this logic, each clock would have a start or end time as a fixed point of reference, as well as another point indicating the "time distance" from the fixed point.

Each clock slice would have a start or end time as a fixed point of reference, as well as another point indicating the "time distance" from the fixed point.

A clock face can be divided in multiple ways.

If we use each of the 12 hours on a clock as delimiters, we can create 12 sectors (or 12 clock slices) on the clock face. This the key design in a clock diagram.

Many clocks also have 60 dashes around the perimeter to represent minutes or seconds. It is possible to break the clock face up into 60 sectors.

We also often imagine clock slices in terms of quarter-hours (4 sectors of clock time per hour) and half-hours (2 sectors of clock time per hour).

## News Wheels

On terrestrial radio stations that broadcast the all-news format, the clock face is divided into clock slices that contain different topics. On these radio stations, traffic and weather are provided every 10 minutes, while sports, business, and other news topics are delivered once per half hour.

These "news wheel" radio stations repeat this cycle once per hour for 24 hours each day. You could use a clock diagram to visualize the hourly news content.

## Clock slice components

Each of the clock slices can be also associated with angles around a 360-degree circle. Each hour is offset by 30 degrees; each minute or second is separated by 6 degrees.

These details are very important in a later chapter (35.8 Clock Hands Angles). For now, we are focusing on the idea of the distance between two very close points on a timeline.

Clock slices can represent the duration between clock times. In the previous chapter (35.3 Clock Basics), we talked about how each clock time can be represented by the "distance" in minutes from the prior midnight.

If we have two clock times, we can calculate the duration of the clock slice on the timeline. For example, we can create a clock slice between 5:00 AM and 7:00 PM. The size of the slice is 14 hours.

```slice here```

We can use the calculation of clock slice duration for many other tasks, such as computing the amount of daylight, between sunrise and sunset (35.5 Day Basics). We will go into more detail about that in the next chapter. For now, let us look at more examples of clock slices.

## Countdown clocks

Countdown clocks (timers) are designed to count time in reverse towards an event (or a point of reference).

In many sports, we often use timers to count down to the end of a quarter or period. We can also use countdown clocks to measure clock slices leading up to space rocket launches, retail sale events, or even rock concerts.

[![Europe - The Final Countdown (Official Video)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jK-NcRmVcw/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw "Europe - The Final Countdown (Official Video)")

As a timer counts down, we are measuring the amount of time remaining in a specific duration. When the countdown reaches zero, time goes on. WE see this is the [NASA countdown clock](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/countdown101.html).

While time on a countdown clock is running out (or moving towards zero), it may add pressure to a situation. Time is neither speeding up nor slowing down, but as time runs out on the clock, our perception of time can change.

This is why training is important in everything -- including test-taking -- to help improve your performance as time is running out.

[![Apollo 440 - Time Is Running Out (Official Audio)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OEqhS80_MCI/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEqhS80_MCI "Apollo 440 - Time Is Running Out (Official Audio)")

# 35.5 Day Basics

The past two chapters (35.3 Clock Basics, 35.4 Clock Slices) have focused on clocks.

Clocks added an automated way to track bundles of time, which allowed communities to focus on other ideas and tasks. With that automation, time management of duration (clock slices) between clock times became more practical.

With clocks, the scheduling and recording of time-based events also has become more efficient. Today we experience this impact when we check train departure times or retail store hours. In other words, business and travel occur in clock slices.

As we discussed earlier, there are 24 hours in a day (35.1 Time Basics). Part of each day includes daylight, which describes the clock slice between the events of sunrise and sunset.

Sunrise is the event where the Sun moves above the horizon. During daylight hours the Sun travels across the sky.

Sunset occurs when the Sun moves below the horizon. Daylight hours are often mentioned in weather reports as day length.

The measurement "Length of Day" is listed in the Astronomy section of this weather report on Weather Underground:

Earth rotates about a tilted axis. This affects the amount of day length during the year. In the Northern Hemisphere, there is more daylight in the June. On the other hand, in the Southern Hemisphere have the most daylight in December.

Therefore, the sunrise and sunset times are affected by both date and location.

### Using Wolfram Alpha

You can specify both the date and location for sunrise and sunset times in your query:
  + [sunrise london may 1](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sunrise+london+may+1)
  + [sunset new york march 15](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sunset+new+york+march+15)
  + [day length seattle october 31](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=day+length+seattle+october+31)

Let us complete some exercises for practice.

### Exercise 35.5.1

Find the sunrise times, sunset times, and day lengths for different locations around the world for the following dates:

+ January 1
+ March 15
+ July 4
+ October 31
+ December 25

### Exercise 35.5.2

Convert the sunrise and sunset clock times in [EXERCISE 35.5.1](#exercise-3551) to scalars. Add units of "minutes since midnight" for each conversion. Calculate the day length for each location using units of "minutes of daylight" for the day length time slice.
