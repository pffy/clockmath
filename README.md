## Overview

**There are 8 sections in this workbook.** This workbook begins by discussing the idea of time and the units we use to group moments in time. After we review first principles and vocabulary and related to time, we introduce the concept of timekeeping using clocks or chronometers.

Next, we use symbols, scalars. and units to describe and predict various day events. Clock times are the symbols that are converted to scalars on number lines, which are characterized by units. These number lines implement geometric concepts that we can use to predict the position of the sun throughout the day.

Additionally, students practice converting clock times into the corresponding clock hands angles that are displayed on analog clock faces to represent time.

The workbook concludes with a review of all the key concepts and some open-ended design problems. This OER includes media (e.g., YouTube videos) and technical computing demonstrations (e.g., Wolfram Alpha).

Also, unlike many workbooks or textbooks that try to cover many topics, this OER is specifically designed to focus on the math skills required to solve clock math problems.

The process of reaching any learning goal in math requires a balance of practice (recognition and repitition), higher order thinking skills, and relevance to real-world applications.

We highly recommend that you do not cram or rush to finish all the sections and exercises in this workbook. Instead, please take your time.

# 35.1 Time Basics

Time is simply a tool. No, no, no: not a manual or power tool, like ones at Home Depot.

Time is an abstract tool. Because it is an abstract tool, time is an interesting idea that can be applied to building or understanding other things.

Again, time is simply a tool.

When we think about tools, we often think about hammers, screwdrivers, and wrenches. Measuring tapes are also very useful tools. They help us measure distances between two points in space.

Time is a valuable tool in a similar way. It was invented to help us measure the distance between moments. In order to conduct that measurement between moments, time requires a fixed point of reference, which is usually an event.

In this workbook, we focus on solar events because they are reliable, recurring events.

Here are some examples of time words that use a point of reference: yesterday, today, tomorrow, before, now, after, long ago, soon, and forever.

Each of these words implicitly refer to some positive or negative distance from a **fixed point of reference** in time.

Time on Earth is based on events related to the motion of Earth within our Solar system. From scientific evidence, we can use the following facts as first principles:

  + **There are 365 days in a year.** Earth revolves around the Sun, once per year. This reliable, recurring event helps us track months and years on Earth.
  + **There are 24 hours in a day.** Earth rotates about its axis, once per day. This recurring event allows us to track sunrise and sunset times, which are partly based on geolocation, as well as Earth's orbit around the Sun.

These facts are integrated into human language. When clock time is mentioned, we implicitly use these first principles to describe the amount of time that has elapsed since a new day (midnight), a new month, or a new year.

For example, colloquially, we say "7:30 AM" instead of saying "it has been 7 hours and 30 minutes since midnight" because it is more convenient and easier to comprehend.

However, in our math calculations, it is very important for us to include explanatory units, such as "since midnight" for clarity (following MUCOW standards).

After midnight, another day begins.

[![After Midnight](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkWccgl-9vs/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkWccgl-9vs "After Midnight")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: After midnight - Eric Clapton**

For intraday clock math problems, we will usually have between 0 and 24 hours (or 1440 minutes) since midnight.

Midnight and other boundary condition are a very important details that we must consider when solving elapsed time word problems. Time problems tend to be design problems due to the continuous nature of time.

Each day can be viewed as a slice of time (discussed further in [35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices).

An abstraction of these events (e.g., since midnight, since the new year, etc.) can be placed on a number line.

Thus, time can represented by a number line, too. This special type of number line is often called a timeline.

Timelines can be labeled with either symbols or scalars to represent points in time.

> **NOTE:** Scalars are often mentioned in the context of vector mathematics. In this workbook, we will discuss scalars as real numbers that may be optionally accompanied by units.

Timelines can be used to represent sequential or simultaneous events. There are many examples of timelines, including historical timelines (in years) or podcast playlist (in minutes).

**Calendars** are timelines, too.

You can view calendar timelines using a big picture view, such as months or years (e.g., financial or marketing schedules). You can also use a detailed view, such as hours or minutes (e.g., radio stations schedules).

We have introduced the basics of time that will be used throughout this workbook.

In the next section ([35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices)), we will explore how slicing and bundling time into groupings can be very useful.

Until then, take a few moments to review what we have discussed in this chapter.

When it comes to mastering time basics, the time is now.

<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Time after time - Cyndi Lauper**

In the previous section, we discussed the utility and basics of a useful tool called time.

Time is used to measure the distance between moments. We use Earth's movements in our solar system to determine how to add numerical values that describe the "distances" between those moments.

Moments come and go, based on our frame of reference. Our memories are recollections of those past moments. These memories feel like they take us back in time.

### Sooner or later

Sooner or later, you need to make choice about what you plan to do next. Your choice may be based on past events or prior knowledge from wiser people.

You still need to make choice.

That choice will be made sooner (a future time with a smaller delay) or later (a future moment with a much larger time slice).

## Anticipating time

Time is a tool that helps us understand past moments while allowing us to make reasonable predictions for future moments. It is true that we may often reminisce about past moments. 

We can also celebrate the arrival of a future or current moment. We have anticipated a specific moment for a certain amount of time (a time slice). We experience this feeling every New Year's Eve, as we countdown the moments until New Year's Day.

[![At Last](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1qJU8G7gR_g/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qJU8G7gR_g "At Last")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: At last - Etta James**

In this section, we will discuss how time slices (groups of time) can be even more useful when measured and compared.

Let us practice identifying and describing time slices. Time slices in nature can be based on seasonal events (e.g., Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter).

[![Four Seasons ~ Vivaldi](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GRxofEmo3HA/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA&feature=emb_title "Four Seasons ~ Vivaldi")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: The Four Seasons - Antonio Vivaldi**

In other cases, time slices can be used to denote an era or special time period (e.g., the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, the Victorian era, ante meridiem, post meridiem, etc).

Time slices can also be described as "bundles" of time. For example, wall calendars help us comprehend the passage of time in years, months, weeks, and days.

To help us manage modern time, we have grouped 7 days into a week and at least 28 days into every month. No matter how many days in each month, there are exactly 12 months in a year.

We use this understanding to plan for the future. For example, if something is scheduled to happen in 15 months, we automatically understand that the event will happen in the following year.

Using another example, in the tech industry, the second Tuesday of every month is called **[Patch Tuesday](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/insiders-guide-to-managing-microsoft-patch-tuesday/)**. The predictability of this day allows companies to plan for computer hardware and software maintenance.

Automatic updates also occur when computers reach a specific time, which is often coordinated to occur during Patch Tuesday. Computers cannot read a calendar or check clocks like humans. Instead, the internal logic implements [UNIX epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) or a similar time system. Thie time is often delivered in seconds or microseconds. 

> **NOTE:** The SI units for time are seconds. [Learn more](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/current.html)

The numerical measurement of time between two moments can be called duration. **Duration** is a length of time. In other words, duration is a slice of time that describes the distance between two moments.

### EXERCISE 35.2.1

Calculate the duration between two times using a spreadsheet.

  + 5:00 AM; 7:00 PM
  + 9 AM; 5 PM
  + 3 AM; 12 PM

### EXERCISE 35.2.1 EXEMPLAR

Duration is an important calculation for business, so most modern spreadsheets have simple built-in time functionality. For your convenience, a lot of the computation is done in the background.

```visualbasic
="7:00PM"-"5:00AM"
```
> **NOTE:** You must change the spreadsheet cell format to "Duration".

[**Copy this Google spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqHJXqH78zOxD1AmwDdRc8czpargdVxZuRtGy5PKpIo/copy) to get started. Change the start time or end time to find new durations.

## Bundles of time

In this math workbook, slices describe *the parts of a whole,* like the slices from a pie (or pizza). Sometimes these fractions are combined with other whole pies.

Think about leftover pizza from a birthday party and how you combine the slices for storage in the freezer or donation to charities that fight hunger. As you collect mutliple leftovers from multiple boxes, you will accumulate bundles of pizza (whole pizzas) that can be eaten later.

It is also important to note that even though these pizza slices are bundled, you still know how many total slices that are available.

Music albums are comprised of individual audio tracks. Each of those tracks can be described with a duration as a clock time (discussed later in [35.3 Clock Basics](#353-clock-basics)) in minutes and seconds.

Instead of using seconds, we use bundles of seconds to describe the various track times.

Some baking recipes call for heating food in an oven for durations between 75 and 85 minutes. In this case, the recipes are specifically using minutes to bundle the number of seconds needed for baking, while allowing easy comparisons between other baking times.

Even though seconds are used to measure time from moment to moment, we bundle those seconds into larger units in order more efficiently use time as a tool to better communicate or understand ideas.

| quantity  | = | bundle |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 60 seconds | = | 1 minute |
| 60 minutes | = | 1 hour |
| 24 hours | = | 1 day |
| 7 days | = | 1 week |
| 52 weeks | = | 1 year |
| 365 days | = | 1 year |

## Time Zones

Let us now reflect on the pizza slice analogy for a moment. The pizza is a flat object, so we generally think about the slices as sections of a circle.

As the Earth rotates about its axis, the Sun shines on certain regions. That rotation is constant, so technically there can be over 86,400 different time slices on a spherical Earth.

To simplify timekeeping, we have created at least 24 time zones to help us group these moments into fewer time slices. With time zones, time management is less stressful and more cost-effective.

Now, let us talk about another kind of timekeeping, which is defined by time signatures in music,

## Time Signatures

Composers share musical ideas with performers using a time recording tool called sheet music. The musical notes in sheet music are divided into written time slices called measures. Each measure provides a bookmark for quick reference, and helps organize the amount of sound (or silence) throughout a composition.

The tempo and structure of the musical composition is mainly determined by time signature. Time signatures indicate the number of beats per measure, as well as the notation basis for each beat. For example, a 2/4 time signature in a musical work (often simply communicated as "music in 2/4 time") indicates that there two beats measure and the quarter note is the basis for each beat.

Singers and instrumentalists look at the time signature of the music composition to better understand the pace or style of the musical work.

Some musical genres use certain time signatures to organize musical ideas.

Marches are usually in 2/4 time. This helps participants in a parade march to the beat with precision. Each measure is typically marked by the loud "boom" of a bass drum. Every Fourth of July, John Philip Sousa's "Washington Post March" can be heard being played from coast to coast.

[![Sousa - The Washington Post March](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOCxegQupMU/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOCxegQupMU&feature=emb_title "Sousa - The Washington Post March")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: The Washington Post March - JP Sousa**

Waltzes are generally in 3/4 time. The beginning of each ("boom-chuck-chuck") measure helps ballroom dancers keep pace with the music. One of the most famous waltzes in the world is the "The Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss (junior).

[![Johann Strauss II - The Blue Danube Waltz](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CTYymbbEL4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTYymbbEL4 "Johann Strauss II - The Blue Danube Waltz")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: The Blue Danube Waltz - Johann Strauss II**

Many musical compositions are written in 4/4 time (also known as common time), which makes it a versatile time tool for orchestral composers. For example, Franz Joseph Haydn uses common time in the "Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major", a classical music piece that was used as a way to demonstrated the features of a new Anton Weidinger invention called the keyed trumpet.

[![Alison Balsom, 'Haydn Trumpet Concerto in Eb, 1st mov.' (Allegro)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUZYoVw7moc/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUZYoVw7moc "Alison Balsom, 'Haydn Trumpet Concerto in Eb, 1st mov.' (Allegro)")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Trumpet Concerto in E-flat - FJ Haydn**

Some songs have more than 4 beats per measure, such as Dave Brubeck's jazz standard called "Take Five", written in 5/4 time. There are 5 beats in each measure.

[![Dave Brubeck - Take Five](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vmDDOFXSgAs/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs&feature=emb_title "Dave Brubeck - Take Five")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Take five - Dave Brubeck**

Dave Brubeck also wrote "Unsquare Dance", which has a time signature of 7/4 time. The tempo increases gradually throughout the song, but we still always have 7 beats per measure.

[![Unsquare Dance](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lbdEzRfbeH4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbdEzRfbeH4&feature=emb_title "Unsquare Dance")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Unsquare Dance - Dave Brubeck**

Additionally, songs can alternate between two or more time signatures, such as "Turn It On Again" by Genesis.

[![Genesis - Turn It on Again](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/StfLy3pzno0/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StfLy3pzno0 "Genesis - Turn It on Again")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Turn it on again - Genesis**

Time signatures also serve as a useful tool to ensure all the sounds (or silence) of each measure adds up. For example, in 4/4 time (also known as common time), we have 4 beats per measure, with the quarter note as the basis. If there is a whole note (which is equal to 4 quarter notes) in the measure, no other notes can be added in that measure. On the other hand, if there are two quarter notes in the measure, the remaining notes may include a half note (which is equal to 2 quarter notes).

The main idea here is that time signatures provide a mathematical structure for musical composition and performance. The notation helps the composer organize the notes (and multiple instruments) into manageable time slices, while providing more comprehensible information for performers.

Here is an example from the film Amadeus (1984), where two composers are using time signatures and measures to organize various vocalists and instrumentalists on a score.

[![Mozart and Salieri write 'Requiem in D Minor' (Full HD) - Amadeus (1984)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USe-wZ0AOQQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USe-wZ0AOQQ&feature=emb_title "Mozart and Salieri write 'Requiem in D Minor' (Full HD) - Amadeus (1984)")
<br/>**VIDEO ðŸŽ¥ from Amadeus(1984)**

As we have discussed, time signatures help us organize musical ideas. We will now explore how tempo is used to control the rate at which these ideas are played.

## Tempo

While the time signature in music defines the beats per measure, the tempo determines the beats per minute. In other words, the tempo indicates how much music will be played (or not played) within moments in time.

Cardio workout music tends have a fast tempo, with frequent strong, loud bass beats marking the time. On the other hand, music for relaxation tends to have a slow tempo, with quiet and gentle notes heard for extended periods of time.

Inspirational music may have have a fast tempo with elements found in relaxing music.

<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Pillars of creation - Alliance**

Real-time events have a constant tempo. In order to gain a different perspective, we need to capture real-time events at different speeds. We will now talk about slow-motion and time-lapse video recording.

## Slow-motion video

Slow motion ("slo-mo") video allows us to review certain events from a different time perspective. We can capture more still picture frames per second in order to observe more details about moments in time.

For example, if you spend time in the "film room" studying replays of sporting events, you are often using slow motion to review the progression of events within specific time slices. This is a wonderful use of time as a tool.

Professional athletes who spend time in the film room are better able to prepare for upcoming opponents while correcting mistakes from previous games. The film room is one of many important uses of time for improving both individual and team peformance.

Slow motion is also very useful in other activities, such as crash testing automobiles.

[![Red-light-running crash test demonstration](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S3-esjKXh5g/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3-esjKXh5g&feature=emb_title "Red-light-running crash test demonstration")
<br/>**VIDEO ðŸŽ¥ red-light-running crash test**

When we view slow-motion video from multiple angles simultaenously, we have bullet time.

[![Neo Dodging Bullets - The Matrix](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODmhPsgqGgQ/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODmhPsgqGgQ&feature=emb_title "Neo Dodging Bullets - The Matrix")
<br/>**VIDEO ðŸŽ¥ bullet time from Matrix(1999)**

When we mix bullet time with computational photography, you can generate [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) and other 3D informatics.

We can view slow-motion as a high-resolution time inspection tool. Let us now look at a low-resolution time tool called time lapse.

## Time-lapse video

The time-lapse photography technique allows us to capture fewer details about smaller moment, while providing a better time perspective of much larger moments.

We can see a valuable application of this principle in time-lapse video (or film).

While slow-motion video adds more picture frames per socond, time-lapse video may only record new picture frames every minute or every hour. This is a popular film technique on construction sites over several months.

[![Home Build Time-Lapse](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fb531GJrCQY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb531GJrCQY&feature=emb_title "Home Build Time-Lapse")
<br/>**VIDEO ðŸŽ¥ home construction time-lapse**

Also, we can watch plants grow over several days.

## High-frequency trading

Time is money. 

This maxim is more relevant than ever on Wall Street and financial markets. Around the clock, money is constantly moving or growing depending on the investment decisions of investors. Technology allows computers to now make thousands of decisions every second or millisecond, which allows more trades to be executed than is humanly possible.

**High-frequency trading (HFT)** is the new way that institutional investors buy and sell securities through computerized and automated trading platforms. HFT removes the "thinking time" and "reaction time" from investing and allows the daily trading procedures to be managed by technology. This provides a significant time advantage over human investors.

Many of these HFT systems constantly monitor several data sources and news feeds to automatically make investment decisions for institution investors (even while they are sleeping). The reaction time and trade execution time have been optimized over many years to be fast and profitable, making several thousand trades every second. 

By the time a human investor performs research and makes an investment decision, the price action of a stock has already changed, which may make the investment research outdated or useless. Also, an automated HFT system may have bought and sold the same stock thousands of times making small profits per trade that add up to significant returns over time.

For humans, time is passing in seconds. For the HFT systems, time is passing in milliseconds (a thousand views per second) or even microseconds (a million views per second), depending on the quality of software, hardware, Internet connection, and proximity to trading centers.

In the next section, we discuss how innovation in timekeeping gives us more time to focus on other things.


# 35.3 Clock Basics

[![Hung Up](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/20OGm_-RebE/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20OGm_-RebE "Hung Up")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Hung Up - Madonna**

Clock time is a tool that helps us keep track of another tool called time (as discussed in earlier in [35.1 Time Basics]($351-time-basics)). Clock time is often represented by a symbol (e.g., 6:30 AM, 13:15) that refers to an event-based time.

If we simply look at clock time as "something" we should know, then we may not completely understand what the symbols represent.

Instead, we will look more closely and carefully at clock time as a symbol and reflect on how we interpret that symbol to communicate specific moments in time.

When we learn to count to ten, we are using a base 10 numerals. Larger numbers are grouped in bundles of 10 whenever possible.

Clock time introduces us to base 60 (or [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal)) counting. We bundle 60 seconds in a minute; we also group 60 minutes in an hour.

In other words, we count from 0 to 59 seconds, and add a minute to our overall total. Also, when reach 60 minutes, another hour has elapsed.

With this in mind, let us think about the math we use when we set an analog clock or mechanical watch. We know the current clock time, and we need to set that clock to match that time.

A complete 60-minute trip around the clock face is 360 degrees. That fact helps us determine an approximate angle for the minute hand.

Our minds are set on the percentage of those 60 minutes that have elapsed within the hour, Percentage represent a fraction of 100, but each minute (of the hour) is a fraction of 60.

[![George Harrison - Got My Mind Set On You (Version II)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_71w4UA2Oxo/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_71w4UA2Oxo "George Harrison - Got My Mind Set On You (Version II)")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Got my mind set on you - George Harrison**

If we look at clock time as a symbol that describes two quantities, we can see a mixed number.

For example, let us look at the clock time 6:30 AM.

In this case, the colon separates the mixed number into two parts.

The left side of the clock time is the whole number part that represents the current hour. We are in the six o'clock hour, which is more than 6 hours after midnight.

The right side of the clock time is the fractional part that indicates the number of minutes that have elapsed since the top of the hour. Within the six o'clock hour, 30 minutes have passed and 30 minutes remain.

The fraction of the hour can be written as 30/60 hours (or 0.5 hours).

Mixed numbers are usually written as whole numbers in large text with fractions in smaller text. This is simply notation to help us better understand the quantity. Clock time uses the same concept of mixed numbers, but uses a different notation.

Clock time is a mixed number that contains information about whole hours and fractions of hours.

Because clock time (as a mixed number) is common in clock math, this workbook has a table that helps us make calculations with fractions of 60 ([Table B: Fractions of 60](/TABLE-B#table-b)).

> **USING ALEXA:** When you use the voice command "time" with the Amazon Alexa voice assistant or smart speaker, the Alexa voice interface assumes you mean "clock time" as input.

Alexa requires you to ask a specific question related to time. For example, you can ask "how many minutes since midnight?" or "how many seconds since midnight?" for a non-clock answer.

In each case, the previous midnight of the current day is the fixed point of reference used to provide you an answer. You can also ask these questions to Wolfram Alpha:

  + [how many seconds since midnight?](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=how+many+seconds+since+midnight%3F)
  + [how many minutes since midnight?](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=how+many+minutes+since+midnight%3F)

## Clock Devices

Now, let's talk about devices.

Some clocks tick to mark the passing of a second; some do not. For decades, clocks have captured the imagination of artists and musicians.

[![Leroy Anderson - The Syncopated Clock](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CrpdQngwk2g/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrpdQngwk2g "Leroy Anderson - The Syncopated Clock")

<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Mountains - Hans Zimmer**

The local event that is the basis for clock time occurs when the Earth completes a single rotation about its axis and automatically begins another one. Every midnight represents a clock time boundary that separates the previous day from the next day.

As mentioned earlier (35.1 Time Basics), we say "6:30 AM" instead of saying "6 hours and 30 minutes since midnight" because it easier to understand.

The 12-hour clock format requires the use of AM or PM to signify the time of day -- whether the time is before or after noon (12:00 PM).

Another clock format called 24-hour time allows to express the number of hours and minutes since midnight without the AM/PM suffix.

For example, when we say the time is "13:15", we are saying that it is "13 hours and 15 minutes since midnight" which permits us to omit AM/PM from the clock time.

> **NOTE:** Another term for 24-hour time is **military time.**

Timekeeping and horology have been studied for many centuries. Before clocks, sundials and star charts were used to keep track of time.

The invention of clocks helped keep local time, but not always accurately. For example, clock time could vary between two towns or two houses.

Each analog clock had a different clock time, internal mechanism, and maintenance schedule.

Many towns simply had a single town clock or church bells to help everyone nearby keep time.

In order to "perform work" on clock math problems, we must learn how to convert between clock times and the number of hours, minutes, and seconds since midnight.

The skills related to clock time conversion wil make solving clock math problems more simple and organized.

### EXERCISE 35.3.1

Convert the following clock time symbols to:
  - number of minutes since midnight,
  - number of seconds since midnight,
  - percentage of the day elapsed

```
6:30 AM
13:15
7:25 PM
12:00 PM
20:45
9:00 AM
17:00
```

### EXERCISE 35.3.1 EXEMPLAR

We undertsand the first principle that every day has 24 hours (from 35.1 Time Basics). At midnight, a new day begins, so each hour since midnight represents a bundle of 60 minutes.

So, for 6:30 AM:
```
[[minutes since midnight]]
= (6 * 60) + 30
= 360 + 30
= 390
```

Each minute reprents a bundle of 60 seconds.

So, we simply multiply 390 minutes by 60 seconds/minute:
```
[[seconds since midnight]]
= 390 * 60
= 23400
```

There are 24 hours in a day. There are 60 minutes per hour. Thus, there are 1440 minutes per day.

We can divide the number of minutes since midnight by the total minutes in the day.

We find the percentage:
```
[[percentage of the day elapsed]]
= 390 / 1440
= 0.2708
= 27%
```

We can double-check our work by using seconds instead of minutes. 

There are 86400 seconds per day.

We can also find:
```
[[percentage of the day elapsed]]
= 23400 / 86400
= 0.2708
= 27%
```
### EXERCISE 35.3.2

Repeat EXERCISE 35.3.1 using a spreadsheet.

### EXERCISE 35.3.2 EXEMPLAR

There are many possible solutions.

For example, we could use the built-in [=HOUR()](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093045) and [=MINUTE()](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093048) formulas in Google Sheets to calculate the number of minutes since midnight.

```visualbasic
=HOUR("6:30AM") * 60 + MINUTE("6:30AM") & " minutes since midnight"
```

> **NOTE:** The ampersand sign `&` is used to [concatenate](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3094123) strings in spreadsheets

Also, we could use the [=TIMEVALUE()](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3267350) formula to calculate the percentage of the day elapsed.

```visualbasic
=TIMEVALUE("6:30AM")
```

# 35.4 Clock Slices

Clock slices describe sections of clock time (35.3 Clock Basics).

On a circular clock face, clock slices may resemble circular sectors (see [Circular Sectors on Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSector.html)).

Sectors are shaped like pie slices. In fact, we can use pie charts to diagram clock slices. The angular position of the hands on a clock also provide pie-like sectors (discussed later in [35.8 Clock Hands Angles](#358-clock-hands-angles)).

On a timeline (a special number line that represents time), we can depict clock slices as linear segments.

In our first discussion about time, we noted that a fixed point of reference is required in order to effectively use time as tool. Using this logic, each clock would have a start or end time as a fixed point of reference, as well as another point indicating the "time distance" from the fixed point.

Each clock slice would have a start or end time as a fixed point of reference, as well as another point indicating the "time distance" from the fixed point.

A clock face can be divided in multiple ways.

If we use each of the 12 hours on a clock as delimiters, we can create 12 sectors (or 12 clock slices) on the clock face. This the key design in a clock diagram.

Many clocks also have 60 dashes around the perimeter to represent minutes or seconds. It is possible to break the clock face up into 60 sectors.

We also often imagine clock slices in terms of quarter-hours (4 sectors of clock time per hour) and half-hours (2 sectors of clock time per hour).

## News Wheels

On terrestrial radio stations that broadcast the all-news format, the clock face is divided into clock slices that contain different topics. On these radio stations, traffic and weather are provided every 10 minutes, while sports, business, and other news topics are delivered once per half hour.

These "news wheel" radio stations repeat this cycle once per hour for 24 hours each day. You could use a clock diagram to visualize the hourly news content.

## Clock slice components

Each of the clock slices can be also associated with angles around a 360-degree circle. Each hour is offset by 30 degrees; each minute or second is separated by 6 degrees.

These details are very important in a later chapter ([35.8 Clock Hands Angles](#358-clock-hands-angles)). For now, we are focusing on the idea of the distance between two very close points on a timeline.

Clock slices can represent the duration between clock times. In the previous chapter (35.3 Clock Basics), we talked about how each clock time can be represented by the "distance" in minutes from the prior midnight.

If we have two clock times, we can calculate the duration of the clock slice on the timeline. For example, we can create a clock slice between 5:00 AM and 7:00 PM. The size of the slice is 14 hours.

![clock slice from 5 am to 7 pm](/figs/fig-clockslice.png)

We can use the calculation of clock slice duration for many other tasks, such as computing the amount of daylight, between sunrise and sunset ([35.5 Day Basics](#355-day-basics)). We will go into more detail about that in the next chapter. For now, let us look at more examples of clock slices.

## Countdown clocks

Countdown clocks (timers) are designed to count time in reverse towards an event (or a point of reference).

In many sports, we often use timers to count down to the end of a quarter or period. We can also use countdown clocks to measure clock slices leading up to space rocket launches, retail sale events, or even rock concerts.

[![Europe - The Final Countdown (Official Video)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jK-NcRmVcw/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw "Europe - The Final Countdown (Official Video)")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: The final countdown - Europe**

As a timer counts down, we are measuring the amount of time remaining in a specific duration. When the countdown reaches zero, time goes on. WE see this is the [NASA countdown clock](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/countdown101.html).

While time on a countdown clock is running out (or moving towards zero), it may add pressure to a situation. Time is neither speeding up nor slowing down, but as time runs out on the clock, our perception of time can change.

This is why training is important in everything -- including test-taking -- to help improve your performance as time is running out.

<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Time is running out - Apollo 440**

# 35.5 Day Basics

The past two chapters (35.3 Clock Basics, 35.4 Clock Slices) have focused on clocks.

Clocks added an automated way to track bundles of time, which allowed communities to focus on other ideas and tasks. With that automation, time management of duration (clock slices) between clock times became more practical.

With clocks, the scheduling and recording of time-based events also has become more efficient. Today we experience this impact when we check train departure times or retail store hours. In other words, business and travel occur in clock slices.

As we discussed earlier, there are 24 hours in a day (35.1 Time Basics). Part of each day includes daylight, which describes the clock slice between the events of sunrise and sunset.

[![Here Comes The Sun (Remastered 2009)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUNqsfFUwhY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNqsfFUwhY "Here Comes The Sun (Remastered 2009)")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Here comes the sun - Beatles**

Sunrise is the event where the Sun moves above the horizon. During daylight hours the Sun travels across the sky.

Sunset occurs when the Sun moves below the horizon. Daylight hours are often mentioned in weather reports as day length.

The measurement "Length of Day" is listed in the Astronomy section of this weather report on Weather Underground:

![length of day in Astronomy section in Weather Underground](/figs/fig-lengthofday.png)

Earth rotates about a tilted axis. This affects the amount of day length during the year. In the Northern Hemisphere, there is more daylight in the June. On the other hand, in the Southern Hemisphere have the most daylight in December.

Therefore, the sunrise and sunset times are affected by both date and location.

### Day Length on Wolfram Alpha

You can specify both the date and location for sunrise and sunset times in your query:
  + [sunrise london may 1](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sunrise+london+may+1)
  + [sunset new york march 15](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sunset+new+york+march+15)
  + [day length seattle october 31](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=day+length+seattle+october+31)

Let us complete some exercises for practice.

### EXERCISE 35.5.1

Find the sunrise times, sunset times, and day lengths for different locations around the world for the following dates:

+ January 1
+ March 15
+ July 4
+ October 31
+ December 25

### EXERCISE 35.5.1 EXEMPLAR

We know that sunrise and sunset depend on both date and location. So, we can pick a random location for these dates.

For January 1, 2022, we will use London as the location.

We use Wolfram Alpha as our information source with the following queries:

  + [sunrise january 1 2022 london](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sunrise+january+1+2022+london)
  + [sunset january 1 2022 london](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sunset+january+1+2022+london)
  + [day length january 1 2022 london](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=day+length+january+1+2022+london)

We find that sunrise and sunset are 8:06 AM and 4:02 PM, respectively. Also, the day length is computed by Wolfram Alpha to be 7 hours and 56 minutes.

### EXERCISE 35.5.2

Convert the sunrise and sunset clock times in [EXERCISE 35.5.1](#exercise-3551) to scalars. Add units of "minutes since midnight" for each conversion. Calculate the day length for each location using units of "minutes of daylight" for the day length time slice.

### EXERCISE 35.5.2 EXEMPLAR

We calculate the number of minutes since midnight for sunrise.

For sunrise at 8:06 AM:
```
[[minutes since midnight]]
R = 8 * 60 + 6 
R = 486
```

Then, we calculate the distance from midnight for sunset.

For sunset at 4:02 PM:
```
[[minutes since midnight]]
S = 16 * 60 + 2 
S = 962
```

We now have enough information to calculate day length.
```
[[minutes of daylight]]
S - R = 962 - 486
S - R = 476
```

The day length is 476 minutes, which equals **7 hours and 56 minutes.**

### EXERCISE 35.5.3

Calculate the day length using a spreadsheet.

### EXERCISE 35.5.3 EXEMPLAR

There are many solutions. Here is a possible one in Google Sheets that uses the [TEXT formula](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3094139). Note the back slashes used to "escape" the special characters in the format syntax.

```visualbasic
=TEXT("4:02PM"-"8:06AM","h \hour\s, m \minut\e\s")
```

[**Copy this Google spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZvg2MyGkdefRPGuOJgnO_bZOPNfJ97tdpqd3MUDsys/copy) to get started. Change the sunrise and sunset times to get new day lengths.




# 35.6 Day Slices

In the previous chapter (35.5 Day Basics), we discussed that daylight hours describe the amount of time between sunrise and sunset. These sunrise and sunset times vary by date and location.

In this chapter, we will divide the day length into multiple day slices. Each day slice describes the subdivision of daylight based on a solar event.

The subdivisions of daylight hours are not unlike the quarters or periods in sporting events. Many athletic competitions divide their total game time into two halves. Each half can also be further divided into four quarters.

In a similar way, daylight hours can be divided into halves and quarters in order to improve time management. While there may be timeouts or commercial breaks in sporting events, solar events are continuous and uninterrupted.

## Noon and Solar Noon

Let us first look at both noon and solar noon.

Noon (12:00 PM) describes the division of a 24-hour day between AM (antemeridiem or "before midday") hours and PM (postmeridiem or "after midday") hours.

We use AM and PM to clarify whether times are in the morning or in the afternoon or evening. Noon always occurs at the midpoint between each midnight.

![noon](/figs/fig-noon.png "noon")

In contrast to (traditional) noon, solar noon is defined as the highest point of the Sun during the day, which can vary by the sunrise and sunset times. Solar noon is always the midpoint between sunrise and sunset.

![solar noon](/figs/fig-solarnoon.png "solar noon")

### Calculating solar midpoints in Google Sheets

In Google Sheets, you can simply calculate solar noon by using both the sunrise and sunset times in the `=AVERAGE()` spreadsheet formula. Learn more about the [AVERAGE formula](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093615).

```visualbasic
=AVERAGE("5:46AM", "7:14PM")
```
[**Copy this Google spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n8FZ0JLPlN_wAtZuTrGcV74z_YES7nkfFnj3dKJyzck/copy) to get started. Change the sunrise and sunset times to calculate new solar noons.

> **NOTE:** Spreadsheet cell must be set to the "Time" format.


### EXERCISE 35.6.1

Find the sunrise and sunsets for the given dates and locations. Convert each clock time into scalars and add units of "minutes since midnight" for each conversion. Calcualte solar noon. Compare your solar noon computation to Wolfram Alpha. Explain why there may be a slight difference between results (HINT: accuracy vs. precision).

  + London, January 1, 2022

### EXERCISE 35.6.1 EXEMPLAR

From our work in [EXERCISE 35.5.2](#exercise-3552), we can use the sunrise time, sunset time, and day length information.

We know that solar noon is the midpoint between sunrise and sunset. Therefore, the sunrise time plus half of the day length equals the solar noon time.

We calculate solar noon.

```
R = 486
S = 962

[[minutes since midnight]]
Z = R + (S - R) / 2
Z = R + (S - R) * 0.5
Z = 486 + (962 - 486) * 0.5
Z = 724
```

Solar noon is 724 minutes since midnight, which is equal to 12:04 PM.

We check our answer on Wolfram Alpha:

  + [solar noon january 1 2022 london](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=solar+noon+january+1+2022+london)

Calculating solar noon has demonstrated that the "time distance" between sunrise and sunset are directly related to the "solar position" of the Sun during daylight hours. Solar noon occurs when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky. Thus, it is precisely halfway between the sunrise and sunset events.

## More Solar Midpoints

Let us now take a quick look at more solar events. Two additional midpoints can be computed using sunrise time, sunset time and solar noon time. These two events are called mid-morning and mid-afternoon.

Mid-morning is the midpoint between sunrise and solar noon. Using the sports analogy, mid-morning is the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter.

![fig-midmorning](/figs/fig-midmorning.png)

Mid-afternoon is the midpoint between solar noon and sunset. In terms of quarters, this event occurs at the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth quarter.

![fig-midafternoon](/figs/fig-midafternoon.png)

Each solar event provides us a percentage of daylight hours that have elapsed. In other words, at mid-morning 25% of daylight has elapsed. Similarly, by mid-afternoon, three-quarters (75%) of daylight hours have passed. At this point, only 25% of daylight hours remain.

### EXERCISE 35.6.2

Calculate mid-morning and mid-afternoon times, based on sunset, sunrise, and solar noon times in [EXERCISE 35.6.1](#exercise-3561).

### EXERCISE 35.6.2 EXEMPLAR

We know that mid-morning is the midpoint between sunrise and solar noon. We also know what mid-afternoon is the midpoint betweeen solar noon and sunset.

We calculate mid-morning.

```
R = 486
S = 962
Z = 724

[[minutes since midnight]]
T = R + (Z - R) / 2
T = R + (Z - R) * 0.5
T = 486 + (724 - 486) * 0.5
T = 605
```

Mid-morning equals 605 minutes after midnight, which equals 10:05 AM.

Now, we calculate mid-afternoon.

```
R = 486
S = 962
Z = 724

[[minutes since midnight]]
U = Z + (S - Z) / 2
U = Z + (S - Z) * 0.5
U = 724 + (962 - 724) * 0.5
U = 843
```

Mid-afternoon equals 843 minutes after midnight, which equals 2:03 PM.

In this section, we discussed day slices that help us practically divide and organize day length. Solar noon is the top of the Sun's arc across the sky, while mid-morning and mid-afternoon provide waypoints on the solar journey.

In the next section, we will explore more subdivisions of the day and how they are used in real-world applications.

# 35.7 Day Parts

In this workbook, we have talked about how sunrise and sunset (as discussed in [35.5 Day Basics](#355-day-basics)) are the boundary events that start and end daylight hours.

We also discussed the difference between traditional noon and solar noon (as introduced in [35.6 Day Slices](#356-day-slices)). Traditional noon divides the 24-hour day into two equal day slices. Solar noon splits day length two equal daylight slices.

Mid-morning and mid-afternoon ([35.6 Day Slices](#356-day-slices)) were also described as additional waypoints along the solar path across the sky.

Sunrise, sunset, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, noon, and solar noon are all points along a timeline that form sections within daylight hours.

Outside of daylight hours, solar events still determine how we keep track of time within a 24-hour day. In this workbook, we describe these important intraday periods as day parts.

In this chapter, we will explore the idea of additional day parts, which include more time slices based on important solar events.

We will discuss the following events: dawn, dusk, and solar midnight.

## Dawn

Dawn occurs prior to sunrise.

At dawn, the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon, and the light in the sky does not count as towards daylight hours. In the weather reports, dawn is often called morning civil twilight.

Dawn promises a wonderful day and sometimes inspires a good mood. The dawn is often associated with a positive turn of events after times of turmoil or strife. This hopeful tone is captured in several motifs in classical music.

[![Edvard Grieg: Peer Gynt - Morning Mood](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-rh8gMvzPw0/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rh8gMvzPw0 "Edvard Grieg: Peer Gynt - Morning Mood")
<br/>**MUSIC ðŸŽµ: Morning mood from Peer Gynt - Edvard Grieg**

The duration between dawn and sunrise varies by location and date. You may be surprised by the size of the difference throughout the calendar year. Of course, you can use Wolfram Alpha as a starting point for your experiments.

### Dawn on Wolfram Alpha

Wolfram Alpha is a powerful computational engine. However, you cannot find dawn times by simply entering "dawn" as a keyword. Instead, you must lookup dawn times using "morning civil twilight" by entering the following input:

  + [morning civil twilight nyc mar 21](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=morning+civil+twilight+nyc+mar+21)

Notice how Wolfram Alpha understands and interprets the abbreviations for New York City and March. You can experiment with abbreviations and see how Wolfram Alpha responds to your inputs.

You can also calculate the clock slice between two clock times using the following input:

  + [from (morning civil twilight nyc mar 21) to (sunrise nyc mar 21)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=from+%28morning+civil+twilight+nyc+mar+21%29+to+%28sunrise+nyc+mar+21%29)

Now, let us look at dusk.

## Dusk

Dusk occurs after sunset.

When dusk occurs, the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon, and most of the light has left the evening sky. Another term for dusk is evening civil twilight.

### Dusk on Google Search

You already learned how to lookup sunrise and sunset times on Wolfram Alpha (35.5 Day Basics). You can also lookup dawn and dusk times on Google Web Search. Simply enter the following commands:

  + [dawn new york march 15](https://www.google.com/search?q=dawn+new+york+march+15)
  + [dusk new york july 25](https://www.google.com/search?q=dusk+new+york+july+25)

You can also search both dawn and dusk times simultaneously:

  + [dawn dusk new york april 28](https://www.google.com/search?q=dawn+dusk+new+york+april+28)

If you work from dusk until dawn, then you probably are interested about the middle of the night.

## Solar Midnight

In an earlier section ([35.4 Clock Slices](#354-clock-slices)), we discussed the event called solar noon. As opposed to (traditional) noon, solar noon varies each day and is the midpoint between sunrise and sunset.

We can make similar calculations when the Sun is on the other side of the planet. The clock slice between dusk and dawn is called night. The midpoint between dusk and dawn is called **solar midnight.**

![fig-solarmidnight](/figs/fig-solarmidnight.png)

Like solar noon, solar midnight is different from traditional midnight because it can vary each 24-hour period.

Let us recall that clock time is a tool used to help us organize and manage moments.

Midnight is a fixed point of reference used to divide moments into measurable days. In order to calculate solar midnight, we can change the fixed point of reference from midnight to noon.

![fig-midnight](/figs/fig-midnight.png)

Instead of using each (12:00 AM) midnight to create a (24-hour) day slice, we can use each (12:00 PM) noon to create a night slice.

> **NOTE:** There are still 24-hours in this time slice. The only difference is the fixed point of reference we have chosen.

In this case of moving the "24-hour slice" from midnight to noon, we must use units called "minutes since noon" rather than "minutes since midnight" to clarify the amount of time elapsed from the specified point of reference.

We are simply taking another slice of the number line (timeline) from a different marker. In this number line, solar midnight is the midpoint between dusk and dawn.

Let us suppose that dusk is at 6:03 PM, followed by dawn on the next day at 6:20 AM. We would calculate the total clock slice between the two times by converting to units of "minutes since noon", while being careful how we use 24-hour time with the new clock slice.

At dusk, a little over 6 hours after 12 PM noon:
```
= 6 * 60 + 3
= 363 minutes since noon
```

At dawn, the following morning more than 18 hours after 12 PM noon:
```
= 18 * 60 + 20
= 1100 minutes since noon
```

Solar midnight is the midpoint between dusk and dawn:
```
= ( 1100 + 363 ) / 2
= 731.5 minutes since noon
```

We convert to hours, and use [Table B](/TABLE-B#table-b):
```
= 731.5 / 60 
= 12.19 hours since noon
= 12:11 AM
```


### Transportation Time Tables

Notice how (12:00 AM) midnight is simply an arbitrary starting point for each day. In planning transportation timetables, a more adaptive use of clock time is often required.

For example, it is possible that a subway train schedule in a timetable starts everyday at 4:00 AM, which creates a more useful fixed point of reference for a 24-hour day slice. This type of computational thinking is very important in software engineering design and systems architecture.



# 35.8 Clock Hands Angles

As discussed in an earlier chapter (35.4 Clock Slices), clock slices around a circular clock face can be characterized using the angles of the hour hand, minute hand, and second hand.

Each of those clock hands move around the clock face with angles that are dependent on different elements of clock time.

Now, we look more closely at the mechanics of clock time on analog clock faces.

As mentioned in a previous chapter (35.4 Clock Slices), each hour marking on the clock face represents 30 degrees of movement for the hour hand.

Each minute or second that passes can be observed by fractional angle changes of the hour hand.

The minute hand moves across each of the sixty (60) markings around the clock at an offset of six (6) degrees per marking.

In this workbook, the clock hands angle is defined as the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand on a clock face.

The passing of each second also drives a fractional change in the minute hand angle on the clock. Similarly, each additional minute drives a fractional change in the hour hand.

The second hand moves around the clock every 60 seconds. In some analog clocks, this motion is accompanied by the familiar ticking sound that helps us track moments in seconds as the Earth rotates about its axis. Other analog clocks may have a continuously sweeping second hand that rotates silently.

Although there are "three layers of time" on a clock face, each clock hand must be at a specific angle at a specific time for the analog clock display to make sense.

This understanding helps us build better analog clocks, both as hardware and software objects. Hardware clocks that provide more precision are more preferable due to better craftsmanship. After all, very precise timepieces are extremely expensive.

Software clocks that are realistic reduce cogntive load while providing the [skeuomorphic](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism) affordance that users want. Clock apps seem very simple, but they must be designed well for customer satisfaction.

We can calculate the clock hands angles for specific times, and use this skill to find the same angle for different clock times throughout the day.

For example, at 3:00 PM the hour hand and minute hand form a (90 degree) right angle at the top of the hour.

For every other hour within the day, we can calculate the other clock times that would result in the the hour hand and the minute hand forming a 90 degree angle.

These solutions can be checked by using many tools, including Wolfram Alpha.

### Making clock faces on Wolfram Alpha

In Wolfram Alpha, you can check your clock hands angle calculations using either visual representations of analog clock faces or mathematical inputs.

For example, if you click on the following link, Wolfram Alpha will generate a clock face with the hour and minute hand located in the proper position.:

  + [7:30 AM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=7%3A30+AM)

Notice that while the minute hand is pointing precisely to the "6" marker on the clock, the hour hand is exactly halfway between the "7" and "8" marker.

  + [2:57 PM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2%3A57+PM)

Notice that while the minute hand is nearly at the top of the hour, and the hour hand has not quite arrived at the "3" marker on the clock.

## Time-angle equation

Let us work through a possible math solution that provides us a working equation for finding clock hands angles and related times.

The angle of the hour hand at a given clock time, in h hours and m minutes, can be computed using the following equation:

```
[[degrees]]
H = (30 * h) + (30 * (m / 60))
```

This equation has been written using spreadsheet formula notation. Also, we have added the [[units]] label to the equation to meet MUCOW protocols.

We can rewrite the above equation as the two components of a mixed number, describing a whole hour and fraction of an hour:

```
[[degrees]]
H = 30 * h + 0.5 * m
```

The minute hand angle can simply be calculated using the following equation:

```
[[degrees]]
M = 6 * m
```

At the top of the hour there are 0 minutes or 60 minutes, which results in either in 0 degrees or 360 degrees.

The angle between the hour hand and minute hand can be calculating by simply computing the difference:

```
[[degrees]]
A = H - M
A = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
```

or simply:

```
[[degrees]]
A = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
```
For convenience, we will refer to this derived equation as the time-angle equation.

Let us pause to reflect. Prior knowledge of clock time helped us formulate useful expresions. We used these expressions to describe the movement of individual clock hands on the same clock face.

Combining these related movements, we created a new equation as a tool for solving a specific problem at minimal cost in time and effort.

We can use this time-angle equation to find the next clock time when the hour hand and minute hand form the same clock hands angle.

### EXERCISE 35.8.1

  a. Find the clock hands angle between the hour hand and minute hand, and
  b. Find the next time the two hands are at that same angle.

```
6:30 AM
2:15 PM
9:30 AM
8:25 PM
```

### EXERCISE 35.8.1 EXEMPLAR

#### Part A

For the clock time 6:30 AM, let us first find the clock angle between the hour hand and the minute hand.

We already know which hour (*h = 6*) and the number of minutes past that hour (*m = 30*). We make the following calculations:

```
h = 6; m = 30

[[degrees]]
A = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
= 30 * 6 - 5.5 * 30
= 180 - 165
= 15
```

We pause to check our work. The clock time [6:30 AM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=6%3A30+AM) can be visualized using Wolfram Alpha. The clock image generated by Wolfram Alpha may look something like this:

![6:30AM](/figs/fig-clock0630.png "at exactly 6:30AM")

The hour hand is halfway between the "6" and "7" markers on the clock face. Each marker is 30 degrees apart. The minute hand is pointing straight down, so the answer makes sense.

#### Part B

We want to know when the same angle will occur again in the next hour. The next hour is the 7 o'clock hour (*h = 7*). We already know the clock hands angle (*A = 15*). So, we are solving for minutes using the time-angle equation.

```
h = 7; A = 15

[[minutes]]
m = (30 * h - A)/5.5
= (30 * 7 - 15)/5.5
= (210 - 15)/5.5
= (195)/5.5
= 35.4545
```

The clock hands angle during 7:35 AM matches the angle from 6:30 AM. To be more precise, we can use the [Table B](/TABLE-B#table-b) to find that 27 seconds after 7:35 AM, the angle will exactly. Of course, we can check this visually on [7:35:27 AM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=7%3A35%3A27+AM) on Wolfram Alpha.

The clock diagram created may look like this:

![7:35:27 AM](/figs/fig-clock0735.png "27 seconds after 7:35 AM")

We can visually compare both clock times directly in the following figure:

### EXERCISE 35.8.2

Find all the clock times where the hour hand and minute hand are [collinear](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html) and point in the same direction.

### EXERCISE 35.8.2 EXEMPLAR

When the hour hand and the minute hand are pointed in the same direction, the clock hands angle is zero (*A = 0*). For example, on a clock face, the clock hands angle is zero for both midnight and noon.

```
A = 0

[[minutes]]
A = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
0 = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
30 * h = 5.5 * m
m = 30 * h / 5.5
```

This provides us an equation for all hours around the clock.

For the 1:00 AM hour:

```
h = 1
m = (30 * 1 ) / 5.5
m = 5.4545
```

From [Table B](/TABLE-B#table-b), we find that 5 minutes and 27 seconds after 1:00 AM, the hour hand and the minute hand are collinear and face the same direction.

We check our possible solution of [1:05:27 AM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1%3A05%3A27+AM) with Wolfram Alpha.

### EXERCISE 35.8.3

> **NOTE:** This is an exercise and a design problem.

Find all the clock times where the hour hand and minute hand are collinear and **point in opposite directions.**

### EXERCISE 35.8.3 EXEMPLAR

When the hour hand and the minute hand are pointed in opposite directions, the clock hands angle is 180 degrees (*A = 180*). For example, on a clock face, the clock hands angle is 180 for both 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM.

```
A = 180

[[minutes]]
A = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
180 = 30 * h - 5.5 * m
5.5 * m = 30 * h - 180
m = (30 * h - 180) / 5.5
```

This provides us an equation for all hours around the clock.

For the 1:00 AM hour:

```
h = 1
m = (30 * 1 - 180) / 5.5
m = -27.27
```

The answer is a negative number. Is it wrong?

No. A timeline is a special number line.

In abstraction, our fixed point of reference is 1:00 AM, and our time slice ends before that point (in the negative direction) on the number line.

We proceed.

From [Table B](/TABLE-B#table-b), we find that 27 minutes and 16 seconds before 1:00 AM, the hour hand and the minute hand are collinear and face in opposite directions.

We check our possible solution of [27.27 minutes *before* 1:00 AM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=27.27+minutes+before+1%3A00+AM) with Wolfram Alpha.

We find this time to be [12:32:43 AM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=12%3A32%3A43+AM) and the computer-generated clock image confirms this.

![12:32 AM](/figs/fig-clock1232.png "27 minutes, 16 seconds BEFORE 1:00 AM = 12:32:43 AM")

In clock math workbook, we are not simply plugging and chugging formulas, we are using computational thinking to create working equations to organize real-world solutions.

In the case of this chapter, we are generating tools (equations) that can be used in quality control of designing hardware or software clocks.

This exemplar was meant to feel less like an exercise and more like a design problem with many possible solutions. 

Time is a tool we use to work with continuous and recurring events. The boundary conditions in this and all other exercises were chosen for convenience. With each new challenge, we make small changes to the conditions or working equations to help us find answers and get work done.
