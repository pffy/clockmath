The Clock Math Intervention Workbook is an open educational resource (OER) created as part of a **small group college math intervention.** This OER has been designed to help improve self-efficacy for college students solving clock math arithemtic and ***elapsed time word problems in developmental math settings.***

## Overview

**There are 8 sections in this workbook.** This workbook begins by discussing the idea of time and the units we use to group moments in time.

After we review first principles and vocabulary and related to time, we introduce the concept of timekeeping using clocks or chronometers.

Next, we use symbols, scalars. and units to describe and predict various day events. Clock times are the symbols that are converted to scalars on number lines, which are characterized by units. These number lines implement geometric concepts that we can use to predict the position of the sun throughout the day.

Additionally, students practice converting clock times into the corresponding clock hands angles that are displayed on analog clock faces to represent time.

The workbook concludes with a review of all the key concepts and some open-ended design problems.

This OER includes media (e.g., YouTube videos) and technical computing demonstrations (e.g., Wolfram Alpha).

Also, unlike many workbooks or textbooks that try to cover many topics, this OER is specifically designed to focus on the math skills required to solve clock math problems. The process of reaching any learning goal in math requires a balance of practice (recognition and repitition), higher order thinking skills, and relevance to real-world applications.

> **NOTE:** We recommend that you do not cram or rush to finish all the chapters and exercises. Instead, you should take your time.

Good luck and have fun!

## 35.1 Time Basics

Time is simply a tool. No, no, no: not a manual or power tool, like ones at Home Depot.

Time is an abstract tool. Because it is an abstract tool, time is an interesting idea that can be applied to building or understanding other things.

Again, time is simply a tool.

When we think about tools, we often think about hammers, screwdrivers, and wrenches. Measuring tapes are also very useful tools. They help us measure distances between two points in space.

Time is a valuable tool in a similar way. It was invented to help us measure the distance between moments. In order to conduct that measurement between moments, time requires a fixed point of reference, which is usually an event.

In this workbook, we focus on solar events because they are reliable, recurring events.

Here are some examples of time words that use a point of reference: yesterday, today, tomorrow, before, now, after, long ago, soon, and forever.

Each of these words implicitly refer to some positive or negative distance from a **fixed point of reference** in time.

Time on Earth is based on events related to the motion of Earth within our Solar system. From scientific evidence, we can use the following facts as first principles:

  + **There are 365 days in a year.** Earth revolves around the Sun, once per year. This reliable, recurring event helps us track months and years on Earth.
  + **There are 24 hours in a day.** Earth rotates about its axis, once per day. This recurring event allows us to track sunrise and sunset times, which are partly based on geolocation, as well as Earth's orbit around the Sun.

These facts are integrated into human language. When clock time is mentioned, we implicitly use these first principles to describe the amount of time that has elapsed since a new day (midnight), a new month, or a new year.

For example, colloquially, we say "7:30 AM" instead of saying "it has been 7 hours and 30 minutes since midnight" because it is more convenient and easier to comprehend.

However, in our math calculations, it is very important for us to include explanatory units, such as "since midnight" for clarity (following MUCOW standards).

After midnight, another day begins.

For intraday clock math problems, we will usually have between 0 and 24 hours (or 1440 minutes) since midnight.

Midnight and other boundary condition are a very important details that we must consider when solving elapsed time word problems. Time problems tend to be design problems due to the continuous nature of time.

Each day can be viewed as a slice of time (discussed further in [35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices).

An abstraction of these events (e.g., since midnight, since the new year, etc.) can be placed on a number line.

Thus, time can represented by a number line, too. This special type of number line is often called a timeline.

Timelines can be labeled with either symbols or scalars to represent points in time.

> **NOTE:** Scalars are often mentioned in the context of vector mathematics. In this workbook, we will discuss scalars as real numbers that may be optionally accompanied by units.

Timelines can be used to represent sequential or simultaneous events. There are many examples of timelines, including historical timelines (in years) or podcast playlist (in minutes).

**Calendars** are timelines, too.

You can view calendar timelines using a big picture view, such as months or years (e.g., financial or marketing schedules). You can also use a detailed view, such as hours or minutes (e.g., radio stations schedules).

We have introduced the basics of time that will be used throughout this workbook.

In the next section ([35.2 Time Slices](#352-time-slices)), we will explore how slicing and bundling time into groupings can be very useful.

Until then, take a few moments to review what we have discussed in this chapter.

When it comes to mastering time basics, the time is now.
